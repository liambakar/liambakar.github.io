                        international stage. While I have faith in our younger

                        While USA volleyball may not possess the same dominance
                        as its basketball counterpart, the team consistently
                        performs at an elite level despite disadvantages within
                        the domestic sports landscape. The core issue is not a
                        dip in performance, but a structural ceiling that limits
                        the sport's growth and cultural penetration.

                        Basketball and soccer have millions of kids playing from
                        a young age. Basketball is an American invention woven
                        into our culture. Soccer has exploded in popularity,
                        especially among youth. Volleyball's story has a unique
                        twist:

                        programs in high schools and colleges. But it had an
                        unintended side effect: it culturally branded volleyball
                        as a "girls' sport" in the US. Right now, there are more

                        plays, and the fierce rivalries between teams. For a

                        fact that their sport is being taken over by fans of an
                        animated show, the truth is Haikyuu!! has effectively
                        brought positive attention and new talent to the sport.

                        From a high school athlete's perspective, there's no
                        developmental or financial incentive to pursue
                        volleyball over a sport like basketball. It's a simple
                        math problem. The NCAA is a superhighway for basketball
                        players and a growing network for soccer players. For
                        volleyball players, it's a narrow, winding footpath with
                        a massive bottleneck.

                        Men's volleyball is often one of the first sports to get
                        cut when budgets are tight. In early 2025, Grand Canyon

                        other hand, men's (indoor) volleyball has no major,
                        stable professional league in the US. This professional
                        vacuum forces top American players to go overseas to
                        play professionally in countries like Italy, Poland, and
                        Japan. Our best players are invisible to the American
                        public for 90% of their careers, only showing up for the
                        Olympics or VNL. With no league at home, there are no
                        big media deals, no major sponsorships, and no
                        consistent way to inspire the next generation.

                        To secure its future dominance, US volleyball must
                        evolve by focusing on three key areas. First, increasing
                        grassroots accessibility by adding public volleyball
                        courts in parks. This would broaden the sport's appeal
                        and talent pool beyond the expensive and gated club
                        system. Second, a domestic professional leagues would
                        make strides for the sport. The AVP and AVP league are
                        great additions, but men's volleyball needs an American
                        indoor league since many athletes want to continue
                        playing post-college. This would keep top talent and
                        role models within the country, providing the sport with
                        more visibility. Finally, the NCAA needs to increase
                        funding for its sports. The system's growing reliance on
                        international talent raises important questions. The
                        influx of foreign players elevates the level of
                        competition but also demonstrates the superior
                        developmental programs of other nations. This forces us
                        to look at how US volleyball compares to its rivals and
                        leads to a provocative question: is Canadian volleyball
                        going to be better than American?
