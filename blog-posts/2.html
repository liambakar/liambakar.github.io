                        Am I following in previous generations' paths when I say
                        "I don't think grade school students should be using
                        language models for their work"? On one hand, language
                        models dilute the uniqueness and quality of student's
                        work, but on the other, tools like Grammarly,
                        Sparknotes, WolframAlpha, and other websites received
                        the same reaction. Today, LLMs are pervasive in our
                        every day life. Most Google searches result in an AI
                        overview response. Tech companies are competing to see
                        who can shove LLMs into more of their features. Whether
                        you like it or not, you are surrounded by language
                        models. But is it as bad as everyone says? Yes and no.

                        When calculators first entered the classroom, it caused
                        an uproar. Parents and teachers feared students would
                        cheat or lose skills, and failed to realize the
                        potential to complete more with these new tools.

                    >
                        If used the right way, LLMs offer a similar benefit.
                        Students can personalize their methods of learning by
                        asking all the questions they want answered. Many
                        teachers say "there are no stupid questions," but of
                        course being surrounded by all your peers doesn't make
                        for the most "unpressurized" environment. Students can
                        now ask ChatGPT "Did an Apple really fall on Newton's
                        head?" without the fear of being laughed at in class.
                        Additionally, students can tailor their prompts to allow
                        language models to answer their queistions in a voice of
                        their choosing (I recently looked asked Gemini to
                        "Explain Vector-Quantized Variational Auto Encoders to
                        me as if I'm in high school.").

                    >
                        Of course this requires a specific setting for the use
                        of language models. Students shouldn't just be tossing a
                        PDF of their homework into ChatGPT.

                        Yes, it is.

                        Language models have the potential to short-circuit the
                        learning processes grade schools aim to cultivate.
                        Modern transformer models allow for the instant
                        generation of essays on any topic. Students are meant to
                        wrestle with ideas, organize thoughts, and struggle on
                        these essays to truly learn. As someone who did not
                        perform well in many English classes, I would know.
                        Over-reliance on LLMs risks turning students into
                        passive recipients of information rather than active
                        constructors of knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p
                        class="text-justify text-slate-500"
                        style="text-indent: 30px"
                    >
                        Others issues also arise from the usage of these LLMs.
                        Many teachers focus on detecting whether or not students
                        were using LLMs rather than grading the actual quality
                        of the work. Students using language models have
                        unintentionally lowered the bar for all other students
                        writing their work from scratch. That being said, LLMs
                        and their usage in the classroom are still relatively
                        new, so I guess we'll see where things go!

                        thinking and the whole package won't be necessary
                        anymore. Maybe prompt engineering is the future. At
