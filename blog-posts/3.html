                        The sensation of "chills" or pleasure experienced when
                        hearing a particularly moving piece of music is directly
                        correlated with the release of dopamine. As the brain
                        becomes familiar with a song, it can begin to release
                        dopamine upon hearing just the first few notes, creating
                        a Pavlovian anticipation of pleasure. This physiological
                        conditioning provides a profound mechanism for
                        cultivating a subconscious and durable connection
                        between a person and their environment.

                        Beyond dopamine, music's influence on the brain is
                        widespread. It activates the amygdala, triggering a wide
                        range of emotions, including fear and pleasure.
                        Moreover, the retrieval of memories through music can
                        evoke feelings akin to those experienced during the
                        initial events (hippocampus). Fast-paced music can
                        increase pulse rate and blood pressure while slow music
                        has the opposite effect. All this to say, music affects
                        you.

                        During a recent brunch at Cocodaq, an upscale Korean
                        fusion restaurant in Manhattan, I was captivated by the
                        harmonious blend of aural and visual elements. The
                        curated music, lighting, and thoughtful design created a
                        palpable atmosphere that elevated the dining experience.
                        It reminded me of the intentional ambiance at Miss Fu in
                        Chengdu in Toronto. Henry shared that he knows a
                        professional 'mood setter' from Hong Kong who
                        specializes in crafting playlists to define the feel of
                        a space. This fascinated me.

                        Every time I've been to Miss Fu, I feel like I'm
                        entering a night club. I can't lie, I love that feeling.
                        Food, music, and good company are tied for the top most
                        enjoyable aspects of my life.
