                        Physicians must tread with caution when treating
                        patients with cancer. Several treatments, such as
                        chemotherapy, harm the patient just about as much as it
                        helps. Physicians must perform rigorous prognostication,
                        the task of predicting the progression of a disease,
                        when working with patients with cancer. Due to the
                        complexity and diverse aspects of prognostication,
                        multimodal approaches that combine histology and omics
                        data, such as transcriptomics, are particularly
                        promising. Transcriptomics is often delineated through
                        bulk RNA sequencing, which provides insights into gene
                        expression. Taking this a step further, protein
                        pathways, a series of interconnected steps that describe
                        how proteins are synthesized, modified, transported, and
                        degraded within a cell, helps scientists comprehend how
                        cells function and how disruptions can lead to disease.

                        Following many prior research papers, we use whole-slide
                        images (WSI) and genomic sequences as features to
                        predict the risk of patients with cancer.
                        <img

                        />
                        One common issue with transcriptomics, especially
                        protein pathways, is their immense size. Not only this,
                        but health datasets, especially genomic, are often
                        limited in quantity. We thus face the curse of
                        dimensionality.
                    </p>

                        class="text-justify text-slate-500"

                        How do we reduce the size of these protein pathways to
                        use as inputs to our GNNs? I propose we use
                        Vector-Quantized VAE. Variational Auto-Encoders are
                        adept at feature reduction because, unlike PCA and
                        similar techniques, VAE learns a probabalistic
                        continuous latent space and not just single points.
                        However, biological data is often sparse, graphical, and
                        discrete. The nature of the VQ-VAE's latent space, which
                        consists of a finite "codebook" of representative
                        vectors, aligns much better with this biological
                        reality. Note that this is not my image, but it
                        represents how VQ-VAE works.

                        Another concern is how to concatenate WSI features with
                        transcriptomics. First thing that comes to mind is cross
                        attention. Cross attention is crucial in
                        state-of-the-art multimodal models. Stay tuned to find
                        out how we query, key, and value our data :)
