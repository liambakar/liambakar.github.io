                        Clinical pre-consultation offers a promising avenue for
                        scaffolding patient-centered care by providing a space
                        for patients to share relevant health information in
                        advance. This process streamlines routine data
                        collection, enabling patients and clinicians to
                        prioritize more meaningful conversations during
                        face-to-face consultations. Pre-consultation is
                        typically conducted either through static
                        questionnaires, which are scalable and cost-efficient
                        but often lack flexibility and nuanced information
                        quality, or by intake nurses, who offer a more engaging
                        and accurate approach but are resource-intensive to
                        train and deploy. Recent large language models (LLMs)
                        have enabled the development of conversational agents
                        that combine the strengths of both approaches, providing
                        the potential for an adaptive, engaging, scalable, and
                        high-quality information-gathering experience

                        In our formative study, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz
                        experiment in which medical residents simulated the
                        process of generating pre-consultation summaries. This
                        approach revealed that summaries authored by residents
                        provided physicians with stronger context and anchoring,
                        enabling more focused and efficient consultations.

                        Our design for the pre-consultation system is as
                        follows: The agent consists of a chatbot interface and a
                        summary interface. Using OpenAI's API, we developed the
                        chatbot interface with GPT-4 to facilitate
                        pre-consultation conversations. The conversation prompt
                        was adapted from the one we had developed earlier and
                        instructed the GPT instance to pose questions in a
                        professional manner, ask appropriate follow-up
                        questions, avoid double-barreled questions, and conduct
                        a natural pre-consultation dialogue. For the summary
                        interface, we incorporated insight from the formative
                        study to prompt GPT-4 to generate a brief narrative
                        summary of the patient's reason for visit, along with a
                        structured table of relevant medical concerns. To guide
                        the LLM's output, the prompt also included example
                        summaries that were produced by the medical resident
                        "wizards" earlier. During an early prototyping session
                        with pilot participants, we observed that the summaries
                        produced by GPT-4 could sometimes produce inconsistent
                        output. To minimize potential inaccuracies, we then
                        added an editing feature so patients can review and edit
                        the summary to correct any changes if needed.

                        The system implementation involved setting up a back-end
                        server using Flask and a MySQL database. This enabled
                        the chat interaction through Python API calls from the
                        front end, while also storing the conversations and
                        generated summaries for future analysis. The front end
                        was built using ReactJS and designed with a minimalist,
                        user-friendly interface in mind to help patients stay
                        focused on the intake process without unnecessary
                        distractions.

                        From the post-study survey, we found that the
                        pre-consultation agent system was generally well
                        received, with 86% of participants
                        <i>strongly agreeing</i> that they would want to use it
                        for future doctor appointments. Most participants
                        enjoyed the conversation, found the interaction
                        engaging, and felt that the chatbot demonstrated a
                        reasonable understanding of their responses.

                        Our findings demonstrate that the pre-consultation
                        system has the potential to help patients recall their
                        history, structure their thoughts, and express their
                        concerns more confidently during the appointment. It
                        also enables physicians to better understand their
                        patients and tailor the conversation toward a more
                        focused and efficient discussion. Together, these
                        benefits support a more patient-centered approach to
                        care by fostering clearer communication, shared
                        understanding, and greater preparedness on both sides of
                        the clinical encounter.
