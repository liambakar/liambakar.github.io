                        In recent years, nutrition has taken center stage in
                        public health conversations, with approximately 40% of
                        adults actively trying to lose weight . At the same
                        time, 2-4% of young adults struggle with clinically
                        diagnosed eating disorders, underscoring the fine line
                        between health-conscious behavior and disordered eating.
                        Eating behavior is further complicated by the fact that
                        food is not only essential for survival but also deeply
                        embedded in cultural identity and social relationships,
                        meaning individuals often lack complete control over
                        what, when, and how they eat. Nutritional tracking tools
                        emerged as a way to bring more awareness and structure
                        to eating habits. The 69% of U.S. adults keeping track
                        of at least one health indicator (weight, diet, exercise
                        regimen, or symptom) can now monitor intake, set goals,
                        and reflect on patterns using modern logging techniques.
                        However, the effectiveness of these tools depends on
                        factors such as usability, psychological impact,
                        long-term sustainability, and the risk of tracking
                        fatigue, a common phenomenon in which users disengage
                        due to the effort and mental load of constant
                        self-monitoring.

                        To balance the tradeoff between time-consuming and
                        inconvenient, manual tracking and innacurate, automated
                        tracking, I propose using LLMs and a series of AI
                        context and techniques to improve nutrition tracking.
                        This allows users to log in a modality of their choosing
                        (image, text, audio) without sacrificing the accuracy.

                            We use OpenAI's CLIP model to extract the input

                        <li>
                            We allow the model to ask follow up questions to the
